## Motivation

The blossoming of citizen science  around the world presents new opportunities for citizens and scientists to work together. Rapid advancements of technology, especially the internet and smart phones, have accelerated the adoption of the citizen science approach across a wide range of scientific disciplines. Hundreds of projects are now focused on gathering biodiversity data. The purpose of the Citizen Science Interest Group (citizen-science IG) is to foster informed collection and use of biodiversity data. The citizen-science IG will facilitate the development and application of standards and best practices in partnership with our TDWG colleagues, citizen science managers and information scientists and a host of other interested parties that may include biodiversity scientists, resource managers, indigenous groups, natural history museums, GBIF, government agencies, NGOs, etc. 

This interest group will focus on the intersection between data gathering and social computing, the development of tools and feedback mechanisms that can be deployed across different citizen science applications, and the ways that new data generated from these projects can be seamlessly linked into existing resources and the broader network of biodiversity data, information and knowledge. 

While citizen science has some clear advantages, in particular the comparatively large scales at which it can operate and the efficiencies with which it can complete tasks, it is still an approach that is relatively new, and thus still being refined. Citizens contribute in a variety of ways but because their training is limited compared to professional scientists, the tasks they undertake such as counting fish or transcribing text information, usually requires less training and expertise than one expects from scientists. This is not to say that citizen scientists cannot be experts, indeed there are many cases where amateur naturalists have more field skills than trained professionals, whose positions often require them to be in the lab sequencing DNA or analyzing data instead of logging observations. 

A logical consequence of the general lack of training in citizen science is that the use of common names is more palatable for citizens than using scientific names. Thus one of the early tasks of the citizen-science IG is to develop a working group that can focus on standards for use of traditional taxonomic resources with common names resources. This focus aligns with other TDWG activities as TDWG and its members have been continually addressing the complexities of the established scientific taxonomic system.

The lack of formal training and certification of citizen scientists often results in professional scientists questioning the quality of citizen science data and disqualifying it from analysis without fairly assessing it’s suitability and fitness for purpose. Thus, a second clear challenge for the citizen-science interest group is to work with the data quality interest group to include practices and standards that can be applied specifically to citizen science data. 


## Becoming Involved

Because citizen science projects often require a diverse group of organizers, this group welcomes participation from all interested parties such as those from the biological, educational, government resource agency, library, information science, computer science, and web and application development communities. 

* TDWG members interested in data annotation and observation standards are particularly encouraged to participate.

## History and Context

Some might suggest that this group has it origins in TDWG’s 2010 meeting at Woods Hole during which the local organizing committee ran TDWG’s first bioblitz . Some might feel it was earlier efforts in 2008 by Steve Kelling and others to bring organism observations into bioinformatics networks. Still others might think that it was Arthur Chapman’s draft of a citizen science interest group charter in 2014 that marks the beginning of the group. Finding origins may be like asking when did the wind start to blow, but what is clear is that interest has continued to grow since the first decade of this century. For five years in a row (2014-2018), the annual conference has sponsored successful symposia and workshops devoted to citizen science. Now there are willing conveners and a critical number of participants to begin more formal discussions and documentation of how TDWG can shape best practices and develop standards for citizen science projects collecting and curating biodiversity data. Extending TDWG’s history in fostering best practices and standards for the biodiversity community to include citizen science efforts seems like a natural extension and builds from experience and strength.


## Summary

Although natural history data have been collected by volunteers for centuries, recently there has been an increase in the number of projects that rely on volunteers for data collection, correction, annotation, and transcription.These efforts take many forms including projects in which citizens put recording devices such as microphones and camera traps in the field, annotate photos (Floating forests, Snapshot Serengeti), transcribe text from specimen labels (Notes from Nature, DigiVol), or share their field observations (eBird, Pl@nt.net, REEF and iNaturalist). Biodiversity themed projects comprise in excess of 85% of the more than 2000 known citizen science projects worldwide, spanning all populated continents. A small number of international projects have brought citizen scientists together for targeted biodiversity events (e.g., City Nature Challenge, WeDigBio). 

Citizen science is already having a large impact in the arena of biodiversity science because of its role in making data available. For instance, about 30% of the total observations in GBIF come from eBird alone and preliminary estimates suggest that 70% of all GBIF data depend on citizen science efforts. These proportions are expected to grow because of the scale of research that is taking advantage of citizen science efforts.  

Data collected by citizen scientists may have additional criteria to meet before they can be considered fit for use; however, these additional criteria remain under-explored. There is a need for best practices in curating these data to ensure that they are maximally reusable by researchers after they are collected.   

The goal of this group is to explore the issues with citizen-collected data, collaborate with other groups interested in citizen science data quality (DataONE, Citizen Science Association, Australian Citizen Science Association, Atlas of Living Australia, Citizen Science Alliance, European Citizen Science Association, SciStarter, Citizen Science Central, etc.), to produce documents outlining “best practices” and standards as the group deems worthy for any aspect of the citizen science biodiversity data lifecycle. 

The group also plans to post their products and findings on Github where biodiversity-related Citizen Science projects could be linked. 

This Interest Group will liaise closely with related and overlapping TDWG Interest Groups, including the Taxonomic Names and Concepts Interest Group, Imaging, Annotations, Observations & Specimens, Data Quality, Technical Architecture and Vocabulary Documentation and Maintenance. It will also support Open Source and Creative Commons licensing wherever possible.
